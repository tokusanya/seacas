ORDER DIRECTORY -- Zoltan ordering tools.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

order.c          -- Routines for computing orderings.

order_struct.c   -- Routines to create, destroy, and access
                    an ordering struct. For future extensions,
                    not useful with Zoltan 1.5.

order_const.h    -- Zoltan data structures for orderings;
                    these data structures are private to the 
                    library (i.e., not seen by the application). 
                    Also includes macros and prototypes for Zoltan
                    ordering functions.

perm.c           -- Routines to compute inverse permutations.
